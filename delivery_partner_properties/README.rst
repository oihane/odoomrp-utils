Delivery - Carriers on partner info
===================================

This module allows to define on partners a mandatory delivery carrier and some
banned carriers, so that when a carrier must be selected on the sale order, it
if the mandatory one is set it will automatically fill the field. If the banned
ones are defined, it will not allow to select them.
